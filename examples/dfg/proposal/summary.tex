  \begin{todo}{copy into the Elan system}
    Summarize the relevant goals of the proposed project in generally intelligible
    terms. Do not use more than 3000 characters, no special characters allowed.
  \end{todo}
  Writing grant proposals is a collaborative effort that requires the integration of
  contributions from many individuals. The use of an ASCII-based format like
  {\LaTeX}~\cite{Lamport:ladps94} allows to coordinate the process via a source code
  control system like Subversion, allowing the proposal writing team to concentrate on the
  contents rather than the mechanics of wrangling with text fragments and revisions.
